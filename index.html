      <p>The lodge is set on the idyllic, palm fringed and secluded Watamu beach on the northern coastline of Kenya.
         The beach is deserted with no other lodges or hotels close by, giving the guests the feeling of isolation, peace and exclusivity.
        Guests can walk for miles each way from the lodge along the deserted beach passing only the occasional friendly local fisherman.

        The lodge itself is deliberately low key and relaxed, yet offering the best levels of service and cuisine.
        Our staff are all employed from the local villages and take great pride in their jobs.

        There are many <a href="activities.html"><em>activities</em></a> to occupy your time if that is what you like, including excellent snorkelling, SCUBA diving, cultural tours, kayaking and surf skiing.
        We can even arrange a day trip to the nearby Tsavo National Park.
